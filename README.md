# PeopleDB
I haven't used flask(or python) for a while, so I decided to make a simple app to get back into it.

It's a simple app that allows you to add people to a database, and then view them.

The app is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), so you can install the dependencies using `poetry install` and then run the app using `poetry run python main.py`.

It is nowhere near finished, so submitting issues through the repo will be much appreciated.

## Future stuff:
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Improved UI design
- [ ] More fields in the form - photo url, date of birth, bio, etc...
